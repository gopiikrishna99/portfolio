We ordered their signature pho and a banh mi, both were delicious, full of flavors and filling. One thing to note about the pho is that they use very thick /wide rice noodles so it might surprise you if you are used to the thin type of noodles from other pho places. But all the flavors was there and the meat was fresh and didn't taste rubbery like some of the other pho places we have been to.

We also ordered two drinks, a Thai iced tea and a Matcha Thai iced tea. Both were refreshing and great! I especially liked the Matcha Thai Iced tea as I don't think you can get it at other places and it looked aesthetic too. 

The decoration was also nice, and they have a brighter front area and a more dim back area, perfect for groups of up to 4 per table. 

Another thing to note about ordering and payment: you can take the menu to your table but needs to order at the front counter, you'll also need to pay at the front counter after you finish. They also have a loyalty program currently where you get $10 off if you eat there 10 times and spend more than $10 each time which is awesome for a regular. I know I'll come back for more!","REAL"

There's another Vietnamese restaurant located about a block or two away that we tried a few days ago so we were excited to try Zen Yai. First of all, the entire restaurant is so Instagram friendly and very well decorated. When we entered we were the first one there since they just opened. 

We each got two Vietnamese Iced Coffees, spring rolls and 2 of their Signature Pho Bowls. The Vietnamese Coffee tasted a bit weird (it was almost as if they forgot to mix it with condensed milk?). The spring rolls were delicious and yummy and had it's traditional taste. The pho was also very well made. The only difference of this pho compared to the usual pho is the noodles. Their ""signature"" pho had very thick cuts of noodles which I wasn't a huge fan of because it was very hard to eat. I would prefer them to make it with the regular pho noodles. 

Overall, it was a great experience and I enjoyed the food and the staff. Everyone was very friendly and welcoming and attentive.","REAL"

Not the case here. They're just savvy with their business model AND their kitchen, and I am here for it. 

There's some seating in the front, followed by a long bar where they make both cocktails and espresso drinks, and a large back area, where the real party is at. There are long tables for large parties, booth seating for medium sized groups and lots of two tops, which is great because it would be a great 2nd date spot (dating people take note).

The summer rolls I started with were refreshing, light, and crisp (from the very fresh julienned cucumbers and carrots) and paired deliciously with the hoisin dipping sauce it came with. I was told the Southern Thai Fish Curry I ordered was the most popular dish, and I can see why. Two rolls of thin rice noodles are neatly placed on the bamboo plate it's served on, next to a metal pan filled with delicious coconut milk based curry and fish. I was instructed to ladle the curry onto the noodles and mix, which prevented the noodles from getting mushy and made for an interactive experience. I thoroughly enjoyed this dish.

They brought out a complimentary turmeric golden milk latte for me, which was lightly sweetened and wonderfully soothing. A very nice touch for this homey meal.","REAL"

The menu is very extensive and so tasty! The service was excellent and the vibe was so relaxed and trendy. This was great space to have a drink, chill with friends or family and enjoy a large Viet or Thai meal. 

I was a big fan of their Pho in Sunnyside and super happy when the same owners opened this location in Brooklyn. 

K and I met my friend and her boyfriend there for dinner. 
Zen Yai Brooklyn had a special of 2 small dishes with rice for $18. 
So we ordered 4 small dishes of fried tilapia with Asian celery, kobocha pumpkin with shrimp, curry beef and chive flowers with crispy pork belly. 

The fried tilapia was good. The kabocha pumpkin was sweet and soft and tasted great with the springy shrimp. The curry beef was so flavorful and slightly sweet. 

My favorite dishes were the crispy pork belly with the garlicky chive flowers! The textures were on point and the chive flowers were so garlicky- it went well with the pork belly.

My other favorite dish was the southern thai fish curry! 
This was yellow curry with fish balls and served on top of rice noodles. The curry was so delicious spicy and flavorful! I could not get enough of this! The rice noodles were springy and perfectly cooked. They soaked up the curry flavor really well. 

The super lump crab meat fried rice was very good! I loved the chunks of crab. The rice was properly fried and had a good amount of egg in it.

Vegan summer roll- this was refreshing and tasty. I enjoyed the refreshing flavors. It was great palate cleanser. 

Kaffir lime Curry bowl- this is so flavorful and very unique. Minced pork with lime and kaffir. Such a unique blend of flavors. It was a little salty but very filling.

Zen Yai Signature Pho- Rare eye Round, beef shank, brisket, ox tail, beef ball with the special Thai noodles. I love love these noodles! They are like steamed rice rolls but in a noodle form. They soak up the broth and slowly unroll. They are spongy and springy. So good! The broth was a little diluted and need more beef flavor. 

The Super Pho- 5 types of meat with tendon and tripe. I love the tender chunks of beef tendon. The noodles were rice noodles that are typical of pho. The broth needed to be more concentrated. 

The ideal pho for me would be Zen Yai noodles with the beef tendon. 

Viet Che dessert- this was such a delightful dessert. Shredded cantaloupe, coconut milk and pandan tapioca. It was so refreshing and light! 

I would def return and order the crispy pork belly with the chive flowers and southern thai fish curry! I would definitely reorder the Viet Che dessert!","REAL"

Don't sit by the booth seats close to the bathroom though, unless you don't mind! 

The menu was a mix of Viet and Thai dishes. I ordered the Khao Man Gai Bowl ($11) which was basically hainanese chicken with winter melon soup.
 
The dish came in a different presentation from previous photos, which was a pleasant surprise. Eating from a wood plate was cool! The soup was delightful with the right amount of flavor. The chicken had a weird aftertaste but it tasted fine after drowning it with the sauces provided. I especially enjoyed the chicken skin and the creamy rice.

The service was spectacular, the kind you would expect at fancy restaurants. I found it inconsistent that ordering was through printed papers but checkout was through iPad. 

Nonetheless, the place wasn't as bad as I expected! A fantastic addition to Williamsburg!","REAL"

"3nATnhLyWRvbUGRwK2zdXQ","Zen Yai Pho Noodle Bar","208 Grand St Brooklyn, NY 11211","","11211","NY","26","4.5","Hannah L.","2019-10-13","Zen Yai's new location that opened in Williamsburg, Brooklyn is a must try.  The place is very hip, clean, and decorated like a modern escape into Southeastern Asia.  The food includes influences from Thailand with the curries, but also Vietnam with the various Pho bowls.  My boyfriend and I went on a double date with our other friends on a Saturday night, and it was pretty busy for them being open for less than a month.  We first started off with some cocktails which are Southeast Asian-inspired.  I got the spicy passion fruit margarita, and the level of sweetness can be adjusted to match cocktail lovers who don't want to consume too much sugar.  My friend got the spiked Vietnamese coffee cocktail which had a definite kick, and was very sweet since it was infused with condensed milk.  The presentation was delectable as it had three tiny espresso beans that decorated the shaken drink.  

I was very impressed that mostly being known for seafood and meat curries, as well as beef pho, that they had a vegan menu that accommodates all lovers of Southeastern Asian cuisine.  We tried the vegan summer roll that came with tofu, lettuce, beets, rice noodles, and fresh herbs.  It was accompanied with two sauces which I dipped my rolls in the hoisin peanut one.  I wish the rolls were cut into more even pieces so our group could have shared evenly, but also for presentation points, it would have been better.  

The rest of the food came pretty quickly, and all of it was amazing!  The flavors were so rich and the ingredients were high-quality.  My favorite had to be the jumbo lump crab fried rice.  The rice was so pillow-y and soft, matching the ample amounts of crab meat.  Every bite was more addicting, and I couldn't get enough of it.  The dish was perfectly seasoned, and literally, I'm drooling as I type since it had to be hands down my favorite dish.  The panang curry was a little salty for me, but I think if I ate it with rice, it would have been perfect, but since I ate so much of the fried rice, I wanted to chill on my carbohydrate consumption.  The yellow curry fish dish was also my next favorite!  It came with soft chunks of fish, as well as tasty fish balls that were fresh.  This dish came with noodles, and crunchy vegetable accompaniments that I forgot to add because I was so distracted by also the chive flowers with pork belly.  The pork belly had a perfect amount of fat and meat, and was SO freaking tasty.  The soybeans were salty and added a nice balance to the sweet chives.  The Zen Yai pho had to be my favorite with generous amounts of meat - the brisket being THE best part of it.  It came with more traditional rice crepe style, thick noodles which I appreciated since the noodles did not overcook while we were feasting on the other dishes.  The broth itself was clean, not heavily reliant on MSG, and if you're craving a HOT bowl of pho, on a rainy day, you HAVE to come here.  

I will definitely go back to try the banh mi's as well as get another bowl of the jumbo lump crab fried rice to share with friends.  The owner is passionate about her food, and maintains the authenticity of her food.  The ingredients are high-quality, and they do not skimp on portions here.  It's an easy 8-10 minute walk from the M train if you're coming from Manhattan so don't let the trek from the train deter you.  The service is great here, and they are very attentive to any questions you may have.","REAL"

The food is still fantastic with all the classic items from their Sunnyside menu like pho, pad thai, etc, with a few new items to the menu like khao man gai (the Thai version of Hainan chicken rice). We had the vegan summer rolls (we're meat eaters and we still found these delicious), crab fried rice, and the khao man gai. The crab fried rice is huge and full of fresh crab meat and the khao man gai was one of the best we've had in the city (comes with a soothing chicken soup on the side with winter melon in it). The portions are overall generous and the plating lovely. 

The interior was spacious with a variety of seating types (booths, bar, large community tables, etc) and stylishly/moodily decorated (I felt a bit like I did in Bangkok with the neon and florals). The staff was just as kind and welcoming as I remembered. 

I would eat lunch here almost everyday if I could. Hoping they reopen in Sunnyside soon!","REAL"

If you get the pho that comes with everything, the noodles are actually more like rice rolls which is unique! The bahn mi fries were amazing- very crunchy, tempura like texture.

The place was fairly empty and we were seated all the way at the back, giving me a lovely view of the kitchen door. The waiter came and asked if we wanted water. Yes, we would. Ice or no ice, he asked. I don't remember which way I answered because I really didn't care and I just wanted water without having to specify exactly how they should serve it.

Anyway, my boyfriend and I both order pho and ask if we can have the chive flower and pork belly to start with. The waiter told us we couldn't just order the pork belly because that was on a menu where plates were 2 for $18. We would need to order a second plate because that's how their system worked. Not wanting a second dish, we asked why we couldn't order just the dish we wanted. He went to go check with someone and came back with the Kafkaesque reply that their system wouldn't allow it.

Well, then. A system (what I thought was a restaurant) that insists on trying to upsell you rather than allowing you to order what you would like is not the restaurant for me. What confirmed it was the pho that arrived lukewarm, nowhere near as hot as it should be when it's first served to you. 

Like a pretty Instagram picture, nice to look at it, but keep scrolling.","REAL"

Not fairly crowded which was good for me but lots of space and nicely decorated interior with a neon light. I ordered some items but the employee was new-which was fine...we've all had our first days at work but I kind of felt like there was some frustration between the manager and employee and lots of tension during my interaction as there were apologies given for wrong actions. I didn't mind it honestly because we all learn but then that means that the manager is not doing an adequate job of training usually...so no need to get mad at your employee in front of me. My drink came out after my food. My pho looked decent - but the broth was not working for me. It was a very bland broth - even after I included the correct condiments to help flavor it up. The drink was pretty good and refreshing though, I'll definitely come back to try something else but this rating was more on my first experience at the restaurant with the awkward employee/manager dynamic.","REAL"

I really love their banh mi because there's a zesty cream sauce spread that they use. I also always order their hainan chicken since I know that they have a specific location in Essex market that I frequent. So happy this spot opened up since I love Thai/Vietnamese fusion. The hainanese chicken is very tender and moist, for me the best part is the sauce. It comes with three sauces and all are really flavorful. I use all three in the rice and the chicken broth rice becomes super aromatic when everything is combined.","REAL"

Summer rolls were great, but the true reason I stepped in, the Bahn Mi was super disappointing. Bread was so so, but sandwich only had a paper thin sliver of cucumber, no carrots a tiny piece of cilantro (had to search for it) and one or two slices of jalapeños on the footlong. the veggie part wouldn't have been enough to for a quarter of that sandwich. But truely the worse was the raw and untreated tofu. soggy flavorless and not baked/fried or roasted at all. Never had a restaurant offer raw tofu like that. really not an enjoyable sandwich even after they where so nice to put carrots and cilantro on it.","REAL"

It's one of a few restaurants that have recently opened in the neighborhood, serving real cooking at extremely reasonable prices (nothing on the menu tops $13!). I've been three times already, so I must like it, although the food has been somewhat variable. The fish curry with noodles was stand out. Just a delicious dish. The Hainanese chicken rice was very comforting but a bit bland in the right way.  The drunken noodles were disappointing. Although nicely charred, the noodles had absolutely zero chili heat and were sauced on the sweet side.  Needed more fish sauce. Definitely bland in the wrong way. Please fix it!

As noted by others , the waitering is notably off/awkward, but I find it charming. Nice small town contrast to the hyper efficient nyc restaurant scene","REAL"

They were accommodating when we had to push back our reservation for 30mins. Our waiter was attentive, but not pushy. 

We started with drinks (whiskey highball and rosemary spritzer). 

For appetizers, we had the special wagyu beef truffle sushi and wagyu tartar. They were amazing. The wagyu just melted like butter. 

For main, we had the porterhouse for two, fries and organic veggies. The porterhouse was cooked perfectly (medium rare). It was buttery and flavorful; however my boyfriend didn't like the lemon herb butter. We thought it overpowered the the meat a bit. 

For dessert, we had the matcha chocolate cake and (1 scoop) of vanilla ice cream. It was a nice touch when our waiter brought out the match cake there was a candle and ""happy birthday"" on the plate. The matcha cake was yum. It was not too sweet and prefectly balanced with vanilla ice cream. 

We enjoyed Salt + Charcoal and highly recommend to steak lovers.","REAL"

The uni &amp; wagyu beef roll was excellent. As sides, the french fries were standard; the baked onion (not pictured) is unique and worth trying. 

However, the star of the meal (porterhouse steak) left us hugely disappointed. 

To start, it took a very long time before the steak was served. I understand that we got first seating for lunch right when the restaurant opened. But we were the first and only ones there for a while. The chef should factor in the amount of time it takes to prep the kitchen/grill, etc. and come in early enough before the restaurant opens instead of making the first customers wait so long between appetizers and main course. 

Additionally, we asked for a medium-rare steak, but immediately noticed that it appeared more like a medium steak when it came. Some pieces did not have any red center at all. I was not discouraged yet since I've had some very good medium cooked steak in the past, but it was not the case with this one. It was tough, chewy, and lacked flavor. We literally left uneaten pieces of this very expensive steak on our plates since they were so tough. The sauces were very good, but I also believe that a truly good steak should already taste great with nothing more than salt and pepper. This one definitely needed the sauces to add flavor. 

It's difficult to justify the hefty price of $53 per pax for the porterhouse steak when it could not even be cooked to the correct doneness. 

On the positive side, the service was great. Our server was very friendly, observant, and addressed our every need. 

To be fair, my husband had come here on a separate occasion in the past and said that the porterhouse steak tasted great. So maybe they had an off day this time. I wouldn't be able to tell though since I don't see a reason for returning.","REAL"

Very on top of their game. Anyways I'll start with what we ordered and our drinks.

I arrived there a bit earlier and waited at the bar. The bartender was very friendly and I was confused between two drinks. The rosemary gin and the yuzu one. He recommended me the rosemary one so I decided to get that one. I ordered my boyfriend the Yamazaki highball as well. 

Once my boyfriend arrived, we were seated right away by the hostess and given the menus right away. Our waiter was very friendly and attentive and knowledgeable in what meats to get. We decided on the Wagyu Tartare (fan favorite), the Yuzu salad and the 50 day NY Strip Steak. 

The Wagyu Tartare was amazing and so flavorful and delicious. The sesame dressing had a sweet kick to it and the nori was crispy and fresh. The potato chips that also came with it was delicious. Next our salad came with our two steaks and while my boyfriend got his medium cooked. I got mine medium rare. AND LET ME TELL YOU. was it medium rare and juicy and delicious and everything I could have imagined. To be honest, I'm not a huge steak person but Salt + Charcoal really blew me away.

Tuna Tartar - alright

Uni &amp; Wagyu Roll - it's good but at the price point they could use even better quality. 

Crunchy Oyster - fav appetizer also recommended by the waiter

Smoked Duck - I don't think the smoke does much more like just for the show. Duck was overcooked on the tough side

Steak - really good","REAL"

I came here with my boyfriend and we were seated immediately. We picked outdoor seating since it was gorgeous out. The service was prompt and our waiter was always around the corner!

We tried the uni and wagyu roll, Japanese wagyu steak, and NY strip steak. We were looking at the porterhouse steak as well but after a few recommendations from our waiter we decided to do without it this time. 

Uni &amp; Wagyu roll: there were two in one order! It came with a crispy seaweed wrap, a shiso leaf, uni and wagyu. They were very generous with the uni! I thought the shiso leaf took away from the wagyu. Overall still very good. 

Japanese Wagyu Steak: this was delicious! The beef was marbled and just the right amount of fat with every slice. It was well seasoned and I didn't have to add any additional salt. The steak was seared and crispy on the edges until the end of all the steak! 100% recommend.

NY Strip Steak: this was a larger portion than I thought. This was well seasoned and juicy as well. The perfect medium rare.

All in all, I highly recommend this place!","REAL"

For appetizer, we ordered the Uni &amp; Wagyu Beef Roll ($32.00). The sea urchin and wagyu beef were wrapped in dried seafood and shiso leaf which gave it an extra umph! The uni was extremely fresh and they give you a good amount.

For entree, my boyfriend got the 50 day Jyukusei New York Strip Steak ($52.00). He said it was one of the best steaks he ever had and the portion was good too. I got the Lamb Chops ($43.00). It was really good and juice. It came with miso millefeuille potato and they were delicious! We also got a side of Organic Grilled Veggies ($18.00) - delicious as well.

For dessert, we got the matcha cake ($12.00). One of the best matcha cake we ever had. The texture wasn't cakey but more spongelike and it came with ice cream! The matcha flavor wasn't too bitter either. Definitely try it!

The entire bill came out to be a little more than $200 with gratuity, which isn't bad at all!","REAL"

Service was polite but not always efficient, and it took a very long time for our food to be served, because our waiter didn't put our main order in.  Fortunately after my wife inquired our food was out in 15-20 minutes.

The ny strip was tender beyond no other. The Uni wagyu was just perfection. Highly recommend trying the steaks here, but if you're reading these reviews you already know the steak is good. There is also a plethora of sauces available so everyone can dip how they like, although the steak is already perfect on its own.

For appetizers, the tuna tartare is the way to go. 
For sides, fries are a must but not sure if the cheese fries were better then the regular fries. The cheese sauce broke apart a little and wasn't as velvety as I imagined. The grilled veggies are also a great addition to have in between each bite of steak.

On top of all that, lots of great sake to chose from.","REAL"

My friend took me here for my birthday and I am so glad she did! 
We had the uni filet mignon to share as well as cheese fries, regular fries and my fiancé had the porterhouse and a friend also had the lamb chops. 
The lamb chops I didn't try, but he seemed to enjoy it. Although I thought it was on the smaller end (3 lamb chops).
The porterhouse was delicious! It was cooked to a medium and even if I don't normally get my meats as medium, this was soooo good. It was full of flavor! 
Lastly- the uni filet mignon was BOMB. It had so much flavor in every bite. It was also 16oz which was a good serving size for both my friend and I to share. There was plenty of uni with each bite of the filet mignon. This is something I can dream to eat again soon.
Their fries was good- when is fries never good!? 

They also have a vast selection of sake. Pretty expensive so makes it worth it to stop by if you have something to celebrate!","REAL"

I randomly searched and discovered Salt and Charcoal. I spoke to Masa, he is the manager, was not sure if he is an owner as well.

We were offered the private room in the basement which holds 15 people comfortably and max out at 20 people. They offered a $75 menu which was quite adequate for the offer. It included a salad, very fresh sushi roll, the 50 day aged strip steak or Salmon or Lamb chops, and the chocolate cake and ice cream for dessert.

We had a very nice time and they assigned 2 servers to assist us. They were courteous and professional. We also tried the crabcakes, the oyster and oxtail soup, the grilled vegetable platter, cheese fries, baked potato  They have a nice assortment of different drinks. I had a prosecco and then had Asaki beer on tap. On the 1st floor you can see them preparing the meal. The kitchen has a see thru glass and you can watch them prepare on the grill without hassle.

They seem very eager to please and the service was excellent.  Most of the people in my party made positive comments about the food. We had a nice dining experience.","REAL"

I came in with my boyfriend for lunch and there was only another group in the restaurant, so I was seated immediately (this is important - the rest of the place was empty). The waiter did not visit our table for around 15 minutes to take our order - first red flag. One note is that some items on the menu have no price listed. Just note that they are around $150+, lol. I ordered the filet mignon burger and my boyfriend ordered the wagyu burger, and both of us asked for our meat to be medium rare. We waited for a really long time for our food. Probably around 40 minutes. 
When our food came out, it looked amazing... until I started cutting into it. My filet mignon was not medium rare - it was basically rare. It was so rare that I could barely taste anything. The thing is, my boyfriend's wagyu burger wasn't medium rare, it was medium well. I have no idea how the chef managed to mess both of them up. After eating half of my burger, I decided I might as well talk to the waiter about it. I flagged him down and notified him that it was a little too rare for my taste, and he brought it back to the kitchen. I waited... another 20 minutes for my burger to come back. I noticed that my onions on the side were gone :( but I literally just devoured the rest because I was so hungry. My boyfriend said his wagyu burger was really good, but I just had such a bad experience due to waiting for every step of the meal. I really would not come back here and I recommend that if you come, do not come during lunch.","REAL"

Once you walk through the doors you feel the weight of the day being lifted as you escape new york. It is very quiet and the intimacy that you have with your partner is unlike that of any other restaurant I've been to.  

We both had the 8-course meal (Omakase) while my partner sprung for the sake pairing (of course I had to sneak a sip). 

The pairing was absolutely perfect and just the right amount for the meal. I would come with an empty stomach for this course because you'll definitely have your fill of gorgeous sashimi (note they do not serve sushi) and various other delectables.

Upon walking in, you see bamboo and pebbles in a makeshift zen-feeling garden, with a little private waiting area if you aren't lucky enough to have gotten reservations like we did.  We were welcomed and ushered upstairs, that were dimly lit with tea lit candles.  I was feeling the mood being set.

We were take to our booth, that was really quite cozy, and VERY reminiscent of a typical izakaya in Tokyo.  Our waitress introduced herself - she was so bubbly I wanted to pop her - and she gentle dropped down a straw curtain, similar to the privacy screen in Ichiran Ramen, to allow us to look over the menu.  It was pretty apparent that we were gonna go hard and go for the omakase - and we got a lovely plum wine to go with the meal instead of the sake pairing (I was driving; maybe next time we Uber).

Each and every course that came out was more delicate and beautiful than the next.  I really loved the scallop that was stuffed in a sakura leaf, and then made into a fried tempura.  On the side was a matcha salt to dip.  I could've eaten a whole plate of these little purses of joy.  The sashimi selections were fresh, and the waitress allowed us plenty of time to oohhhh and ahhh over every offering.  It really was a memorable night.

I would love to have another Girl's Night or really any night here and further explore their menu - maybe even ask to have something that the chef would cook himself when he's feeling homesick for Tokyo.  Arigato!","REAL"

I mean, seriously, what an AMAZING experience. This is one of the restaurants that made my trip to NYC such a pleasure. Let me just start off by saying, the ambiance is just impeccable.

The restaurant is dark and romantic. You walk in and there is a sitting area, amidst shady candle lighting. Asian inspired, with rocky lantern lit look. Very Instagram picture worthy. The host grabs you, and take you to your table. Usually, depending on where you are located, you will climb a narrow set of stairs, very dark and kinda scary, but trust me it adds to the flavor of the restaurant. You are then taken to a small table, it is enclosed, and when you are seated they pull down and shade and VOILA you are in total privacy with your dining companion. The only time the shade is lifted is for service. You press a button when you need help.

Service is impeccable. So much attention is paid to detail. 

The food itself is very deep, taste and flavor wise. You order in an a la carte style. It is not cheap but they have tasting menus, and waitresses are very helpful in describing what you may or may not care for. 

Warm saki was potent :)

Ordered the Summer Omakase for two, an eight-course meal and a carafe of hot sake. The Omakase came in small dishes but don't let the small plating fool you... these add up! I was so full by the time we got our dessert I had a hard time finishing our black sesame mousse - total bummer bc it was so good. I'm definitely doing another dinner out here for more of that.

The highlight of the Omakase for me was the Epicurean Shooter (literally a ""creamy"" shrimp that melts in your mouth) and the Grilled Saikyo Black Cod (perfectly cooked) but all dishes were great - summery - some form of fresh, zesty, sweet, crunchy and delightful. They did great creating this menu, especially for the price!","REAL"

The meal started with a spring sea beam which was a miso soup with yuzu peel. We then got an appetizer platter which included five small tasting dishes - sea bass sashimi, miso marinated cream cheese, micro-vegetables/broccoli rabe, lotus root/snow peas, and scallop tartare (my favorite from the platter!)

The following tasting dishes were as follows:
- Three kinds of sashimi (super fresh)
- Cod &amp; green shiso tempura (prob unmemorable cause I don't remember this)
- Saikyo black cod (amazing- so buttery and soft- we liked it so much we decided to order another one)
- Thin sliced washugyu beef (comes with a yummy yuzu spread on top)
- Chirashi (did not come with any fish, seemed more like a carb-filling plate to me but I was super full at this point regardless)

For dessert we got the black sesame ice cream and the chocolate pudding. Let me tell you. This pudding sent me spiraling into my own happy world cause it was so gooood. I did not want to share this at all. 

All in all, we all very much enjoyed our meal and I was glad I was able to introduce some members of my family to their first omakase experience.","REAL"

Couple that with a beautifully prepared 8-course Omakase Tasting Menu and it becomes quite clear why this Japanese eatery has been widely recognized as one of New York's most romantic restaurant.

Their menu is jam packed with umami goodness, subtle yet decipherable flavors and simple yet escalated bites. The staff is friendly yet accommodating and for the most part are unnoticeable which helps pave the way for a quiet and romantic meal. 

Highly recommend if you're looking for a date night spot in Brooklyn. Be sure to take advantage of their tasting menu","REAL"

The environment is very interesting.

We ordered the omakase; it is a little pricey for the quality and portion. The plating were very pretty and remind me of our meals in Japan, of course the flavor can never be compared. We really like the grilled fish, but the sushi sashimi were not as fresh as could be. The raw beef were a little chewy but the three miso sauces go very well with the beef flavor. The highlight of the meal is the grapefruit agar jelly dessert, we ended on a good note and will definitely go back just for that jelly. Not all the dishes were amazing, but it does deserve a four star for the unique experience.","REAL"

When I was planning my boyfriends surprise trip I wanted to make sure I had a good place for dinner reservations. One thing I look for is the ambiance and I wanted something romantic and intimate. Zenkichi was the perfect place. 

I was super excited because this restaurant had a unique dining experience. Inside it is dimly lit and the entry way has Bamboos everywhere . It's like you're transported into a different place. Each table is set up where blinds come down so it can be more ""intimate"". Great use of space but I wish we got a bigger table since it did feel a little cramped. 

We ordered the tasting menu which is 8 selected dishes for $76 pp (2 minimum guests )

Sake pairing +$50 (6 seasonal sakes complementing every dish )

For the spring tasting it consisted of:

1st course :Sea Bream Osuimono*
Spring sea bream in clear broth, yuzu peel

2nd course :Raw Tasting
*Sea Bass Kobujime
Kombu-cured sea bass sashimi with Namasu vinegar vegetables
*Hotate Namerou
Japanese fisherman's tartar made with scallops from Hokkaido, Miso, Shiso-perilla leaves, fine scallions
*Renkon Kimizu-Ae
Lotus root and snow peas in traditional Kimizu egg yolk vinegar
*Spring VegetablesMicro-vegetables and Spring broccoli rabe served with sweet sesame sauce
*Cream Cheese Miso-zukeMiso marinated cream cheese

3rd course :Chef's Sashimi Trio of the Day
4thcourse:Cod and Green Shiso Tempura
5th course:Saikyo Black Cod
6th course :Hatcho Miso Washugyu Beef
7th course:Spring Chirashi Zushi*
8th course :Dessert!

We really enjoyed all the dishes . Everything tasted pretty fresh and for the price it was exceptional. The black miso cod was our favorite. It was cooked to perfection and it was super rich and tasty. Our least favorite was the washugyu beef. The sauce was a little overpowering a tad bit salty. All the other dishes tasted pretty good. Each plate seems like a small amount but by the time we got to the last dish we felt full.

For dessert we got the black sesame which was good . The soy tofu reminded me a lot of a panna cotta. It was good. I put in a request for them to put a happy birthday on the dinner reservation.I really wished they wrote it on the plate ( like I had seen in previous pics) but the paper happy birthday was fine too.

Overall Zenkichi was a wonderful place and I'm glad we celebrated my boyfriends birthday at that restaurant. If you want something intimate and romantic this is the place for you.","REAL"

Its intimate and a unique dining experience. I like it because its quiet and usually try to book my reso later in the night and be seated upstairs in the middle area, where the seating is a bit bigger and in my opinion, prettier.

The seating area has little shades you draw sown on your table for privacy and a button to call your waiter/waitress. I love that! In the few times Ive been there, the staff has always been very nice and knowledgeable about the menu and drink options. 

Im by no means an expert but the selection of dishes w omakase are unique and taste great. They change periodically but there are a bunch of a-la-carte options. One thing I wish they still had was the sticky rice. I prefer getting a bottle or two of hot saki with dinner because I cant appreciate the cold saki pairing option/s.","REAL"

Very accommodating, staff was friendly and seated promptly. The atmosphere from the street to your seat was amazing, with loose rocks and large foot stones, (ladies-carful with your heels) the seating was intimate and cozy. 

We went with the spring 8 course tasting menu with the sake pairing, which I highly recommend. The tofu dessert was so insane we ordered two more. The portions are small, but the fish and meat course will help fill you up, but for those with a super large appetite, you may want to order al la Carte. 

Parking on the street wasn't too bad for a Friday night. The sake pairing was done very well, and we ended up trying items we might never have thought of. Definitely worth the drive and price!","REAL"

As we walk thru the door, there's a musky odor in the air. Like they haven't done any major cleaning since they open.  3 of us were seated in a booth. The problem is the chopsticks were just on top of the table. Not on top of the napkin or the stand it's suppose to be on. Couple that with the smell and I have to clean them again with my own wet nap. The price point make this unacceptable. We had the Omakase with sake. It's 100 a head plus tip. The food was ok to good but not memorable. If you ask me what I had. I have to think real hard. Service was ok but water refill seems to take a while and lukewarm. Overall, disappointing.","REAL"

That said, Zenkichi is definitely one of my favorites. At a surface level, the decor itself is something to talk about. The outside is inconspicuous and almost speakeasy-like, and as soon as you step foot indoors, you're immersed in a maze of semi-""private"" dining areas with greenery and a stone path. That's just the start of it - the service is very courteous and the food is perfect. Everything we ordered was unmistakably delicious. Our favorites were the udon, lamb chop, and sashimi trio.

This is a great place to go with a couple friends but probably not for a large group, and be sure to make a reservation ahead of time!","REAL"

My boyfriend and I easily made a reservation on a weeknight. 

We started with the homemade tofu and the duck salad, both of which were great. We then shared the Camembert shrimp and corn tempura, which sounded interesting in theory but was kind of gross in its execution. The flavors just did not mesh well and it was a little lukewarm. We followed this with the udon, which was excellent (and a great value). Jewel of the day (assorted sashimi) was decent but there was a fish or two that I didn't like. Black cod was definitely the standout and not to be missed. 

So I found the food hit or miss, but overall good, and the setting is so nice (you get a private booth with your own shade). Like I said, service was perfect. 3.5 stars.","REAL"

My birthday meal at Zenkichi was absolutely one of those!

 We didn't get the tasting menu because it was mostly sashimi which I hadn't tried before (spoiler alert- I tried it here for the first time and it was AMAZING). Instead my boyfriend and I shared a bunch of the small plates: Filet Mignon (insanely flavorful and tender), Sashimi sampler (so fresh and high quality, so happy this was my first experience with sashimi), duck salad (buttery, sweet, fresh, delicious), chicken wings (so crispy and the sauce is so flavorful), potato mochi (loved the dipping sauce and these were just so fun to eat), and the Udon (actually didn't love the udon but I think it's more of a personal preference thing- had a strong seaweed flavor that I don't love, but the noodles were cooked perfectly). 

Our server was so sweet and attentive, and it was nice having the call button which we didn't need to use at all, except for when we were ready to order DESSERT! We got the tofu dessert with red bean and strawberries (so milky, sweet, refreshing, and decadent) and the chocolate pudding (so rich, smooth, and chocolatey. Almost more like a mousse).

The only thing I could complain about is that it's very dark in there with a lot of stairs and I almost tripped many times- but I don't mind a little danger if it means I'm eating this good!","REAL"

Locals 
When I went there was construction around the site, and it had an unassuming entrance. This is in Williamsburg!

Travelers 
They mostly have cooked food omakase, but it was still good! Great for holidays. Not great for big groups of people. Perfect for 2-4 people.

My Recommendation 
I came for New Year's Eve and they had sparkling sake to celebrate. This meal was less than 100 dollars and it was filling! Delicious! Unlike most omakase places, you get a small booth/table for you and your party with blinds for privacy. Service was superb as well.

When we said we thought another one was better, he insisted that we try a sample of the one he suggested. So, we did. He came back immediately and said, ""Ok. so this one you order?"" We said no, we still wanted the one we asked for. He wrote that down and then asked what we wanted to order for food. He suggested the more expensive tasting menu. We told him we needed time to think about it. He said ok and disappeared for a minute. Then he came back and said, ""Did you choose the tasting menu?"" We explained no, that we hadn't looked but that we were going to order from the other menu. He took the other menu, showed it to us and said, ""What are you ordering."" We explained yet again that we were not ready. Finally we had to tell him to leave our table and not come back until we called him.

Been there about five times on different dates, they are the most consistent restaurant on North 6th and I've tried all of them.","REAL"

I'm glad it was my first experience. The lentils on the side didn't really compliment it. They were just there. 
The place really does look small from outside, but walking in there are booths in the back. Our waitress was seemingly kind and attentive. I did have a cocktail, but then again it wasn't memorable. 
It was an okay place to eat. My friend had the curried lentils with shrimp and found himself also craving more taste wise.","REAL"

My husband had the steak &amp; eggs- perfection. Steak was hanger style &amp; cooked exactly as ordered.

We got seated in the backyard (which I was hoping for), which made our meal feel super relaxed. I loved the simple decor of the backyard and the pop pink.

We started off the the mussels and it was so good! It was enough to share with 2 people as a starter or a single person's entree. We enjoyed eating this dish so much - flavorful but not overwhelming. It wasn't too salty and the tomato base was just right. It went really well with the bread, although I wish the bread was just a softer. 

I ordered the grain bowl salad with an egg. It was much needed on a hot day, when you just want something light. It had all the right textures in the salad and everything came together really nicely. I really enjoyed having this for lunch. 

My girlfriend ordered the grilled fish tacos, which was also very nicely made with a hint of spiciness to it. She seemed to enjoyed the tacos very much. The fish had a really strong burnt taste to me (probably from the grill) but other than that, it was good~

Overall, I would recommend to stop by for brunch/lunch/dinner. The staff was very accommodating but just a bit slow on service. The ambiance in the backyard is wonderful. Great place to catch up friends/family or even your significant other.","REAL"

They were fast to accommodate us to sit outside (the patio is lovely and decor is nice, it would really light up well at night). They got us water quickly and our server actually checked on us throughout the meal allowing us to order more if we needed to or get anything. They cleared plates quickly during the meal as well. 

The food: the burger (minus too much truffle) and brisket were really good! Like so good. I would like the option of a brioche bun but I think it's unique what they are doing on a muffin. They have these mini croissants which are good for soaking up the rest of your soup. The salad didn't have too much dressing on it and was good, although not much to it. The sweet potato fries are homemade and were delicious!

Why I dinged them: I feel like the price of truffle cheese ($4) is a bit much and unfortunately I think it was too much truffle on a burger. The soup special was $8 and it was called beef and noodle soup. It was almost all noodles but the flavor of the juice was good. It was a really small bowl and for it to be charged close to meal prices, a lil much imo. I wouldn't charge more than $4-5. Also I asked for my eggs to be overdone and they were really wet which upset my stomach.","REAL"

The outside is unassuming, but as you walk in the restaurant gets progressively cuter. My partner and I were given an option to sit inside or outside. I was confused because I didn't see any tables out in front, but the waiter directed us to the back to show us a secret garden-esque back patio that was begging to host a dinner party.

Our server was cool and helpful. My partner started with the squid and I just stuck to the bread. The bread was great and the oil and vinegar tasted of a good quality. I can't even eat squid, but my partners dish looked like something I would risk an allergic reaction for.

I had the strawberry cocktail which had fresh strawberries, so it was good. For the main course, I had the lamb papperdelle and he had the hangar steak. I got the papperdelle because I never usually get pasta and wanted to try something new. YO! I'm so glad I did! I have  never tasted pasta so good (due keep in mind I'm not a big pasta eater.) I'm usually the kind of person that needs to add some extra sauce to a dish, preferably hot sauce, but this dish was perfect! My partners hangar steak, again, don't usually eat steak, but YO! So damn good and he got it medium which I usually turn my nose up at (I don't care, fight me!). But it was so flavorful, had crispy ends, but still moist. It came with onion rings that were good, but could have had more crunch.

If there was anything the restaurant got wrong was the dessert menu, was really looking for a tiramisu and nothing on the menu looked inspiring to me, but I'm not gonna doubt that they have hits.

Will definitely be going back and already r thinking about hosting a birthday dinner there.","REAL"

If you're looking for fresh, eclectic, great tasting grub in Williamsburg look no further, Sweetwater's got you covered. I came per my friend's suggestion and I'm very glad I did.

First off, bread came at the table and it was not your average bread basket. It had focaccia and fresh Italian bread and came with an olive oil-balsamic mixture. It was so good and really hit the spot.

For the main I got the organic chicken. The skin was seared to perfection - it was crisp and well seasoned. Inside the chicken was perfectly moist and delicious.

I got the broccoli rabe on the side (they put it in for me in place of mashed potatoes at no charge). Broccoli rabe can be bitter but this broccoli rabe had been cooked perfectly so it just had the slightest bite. It was super garlicky and had a fantastic flavor profile.

Will be back soon for more!","REAL"

The food here was quite delicious but it is not authentic Morrocan food. I feel like the food is more middle eastern (more israeli) than morrocan. 

We ordered to share: 1) tomato ginger soup, 2) the mixed mezze (hummus, eggplant, tabouli, arabic salad) that comes with pita bread, 3) the lamb shank coucous, 4) kefta kebab, 5) walnut baklava, 6) morrocan mint tea.

The tomato ginger soup was how it tasted (tomato &amp; ginger), nothing extraodinare. The mixed mezze is a must order as it was super delicious and fresh. The lamb shank couscous was disappointing. The kefta kebab was another must order as the kebab and rice was super delicious! The walnut baklava was good and the morrocan mint tea was disappointing. The mint tea is not the same as the ones in Morrocco  (it was bland and lacked mint flavor)- I can't blame the owner because it is probably very hard to get those morrocan mints. Real morrocan mint teas are very strong in taste.

Staff was friendly, service was good. Decor and environment was nice. 

Despite the food (comparing it to real morrocan food) not being authentic, I would still come back here as the food was pretty delicious.","REAL"

I came here with two other friends and we all had zero expectations across the cuisine options since we'd likely never tried a place like Cafe Mogador (Morrocan food).

DUCK CONFIT: 10/10. Absolutely phenomenal, delicious, with great flavor across the duck and arugula and fries. The duck has a crispy outer skin with tender meat inside. The arugula had a nice lime distinction across the flavor. And the fries were nicely crisp!

CALAMARI: 7/10. This was rather disappointing on my end for me. The pieces of toast/bread that come with the Calamari is not only proportionally smaller but also less. For example, there were 4 pieces of calamari but only 2 pieces of bread. The flavor wasn't the best either.

It is a charming space right in the heart of Williamsburg. The interior has Moroccan touches and is cozy and inviting.

The food here is excellent. I went with a group and shared several plates. The hummus/falafel platter and babaganoosh are, unsurprisingly, delicious. We also had the roasted halumi cheese and a cauliflower appetizer that were pretty tasty.

My favorite dish that I tried here was the Bastilla. It was prepared with a deliciously golden flaky crust and stuffed with perfectly seasoned shredded chicken. We also had a roasted chicken entree and 
whole fish which were pretty good, but I'd probably try something different next time.

The service was great and the staff was very friendly. I definitely plan on returning for more delicious bites. The brunch menu, in particular, looks very enticing.","REAL"

The waitress was very kind, and alert. She was definitely on her A game, since she had several tables in her jurisdiction and everything came out perfectly without any hitch. Also, the food wait time was at a minimal. I appreciated the chill vibes, as they are profound here, with Queen and the Bugees playing on the same playlist.

The wait for two people on a Tuesday night at 7:30 pm was 10 minutes.  We sat in the backyard patio, which they're just restoring for use now that the rather is warming up.  

This place has zero tasty vegan options if you are looking for something cooked hot n steaming that's not all carb laden.  If you're also allergic to eggplant, zucchini, and other nightshades, options are even more limited.  Is your idea of vegan a depressingly cold and small $15 salad?  If yes, then you'll survive.  The couscous is made with meat bouillon so it's not even vegetarian friendly.  

They're under staffed because it does take a while for a server to get to you, but after you order, at least the food doesn't take forever to come out because bus boys can bring food to the table too.  Service was ok, but after ordering, we never saw our waitress again until we had to flag her for the check.  

If you're here for meaty chicken or lamb tagines or bastilla, you're in luck because Cafe Mogador does these two dishes well.","REAL"

We were seated towards the back across from the kitchen. There was a patio out back where it looked like people were waiting for tables.  They have some decent wines on the menu, but felt the pours were a little on the small side.  We started off with the hummus plate which is served with some lovely fluffy naan.  The hummus was an excellent version.

The lamb shank tagine was  divine.  The lamb was so incredibly tender and melted in your mouth.  The mixed grill was served with rice and salad and included, merguez sausage, chicken, lamb and some peppers onions.  Everything was delicious it was easy to see why they have quite the following.

Cafe Mogador offers comforting flavors and a lovely vibe which makes it a great place for a great meal.","REAL"

Sounds like something straight out of Harry Potter. We made the trek over to Williamsburg to try this Moroccan, Mediterranean dinner based on high recommendations from friends. It's not the easiest place to get to from where we were staying, but not too bad nonetheless. It was cold and we had to wait outside for about an hour to be seated. This place was BUSY. No big deal. We just hung out for a while and were excited about having good food.

This place has a small menu. I ordered the Chicken Tagine, which looked real delish but sort of lacked flavor IMO. It actually looked better in the pics than it really was. Maybe it was an off night. At least I got to try everyone else's dish as we shared everything.

The most memorable dishes for me were the Appetizer Plate (if that's the real name) and the Mixed Grill. For me, the Mixed Grill was better than the Chicken Tagine. It was delish and served with a variety of meats. The whole Appetizer Plate was very enjoyable and it came with a variety of things: roasted eggplant, hummus, baba ganoush, and salad

Overall, Cafe Mogador is a pretty solid choice and their prices are fair. However, I do suspect that their brunch menu might be an even better option here. I saw nothing but their brunch pics on their page as I was trying to order my food. Can't say I was highly satisfied since I had 5-star expectations for Cafe Mogador. If and when I do come back, it'll be for brunch!","REAL"

We were told that the wait would be 30 mins but managed to get a table within 20 mins. The hostess was very friendly and welcoming.

Their garden area is really good but wasn't open for seating. It was relatively cold outside in what felt like a spring day. We ordered the  Mediterranean Breakfast ($19) at the bar while waiting for our table and I got a Mimosa ($10). The Mediterranean flavors on the plate were quite interesting, but nothing spectacular. The mimosa on the other hand was really good!

For food, I got the Greek Salad with Chicken ($13 + $5) which was just okay. Again, nothing amazing about it and the Chicken wasn't that great.

Service overall was really good and the entire staff is quite friendly. We had a good experience overall, but food is just okay and there was nothing outstanding about it.","REAL"

I'll think about trying it again but honestly wasn't anything special. Came for a friends birthday and we were having a good time and conversations but the waitress made it seem like she wanted us to leave. She kept coming to our table asking us if we wanted to add to our order every ten minutes if we decided on desserts or the bill.

Their hummus and their babaganoush is great. They come on small plates but it is very shareable for two. I really enjoy their appetizers! Ask for the specials. They have things that are delicious and seasonal. We did the octopus with potatoes and a tomato and saffron sauce. The octopus was a little sparse but the sauce and the potatoes were mind blowing. I also Love that lamb shank over couscous. They do a great job of making it fall off the bone perfect. And definitely ask for the extra au jus. They ask if you want it. Say yes! I get it every time and have never regretted it. 

Definitely do their dessert! We love the orange almond flourless cake. It is fantastic! I also love their pot au creme! It is a chocolate pot that has all of the amazing rich creaminess you could ever want. Enjoy!","REAL"

Some friends and I recently ate at Ela and we were infatuated with the quality and service of this restaurant. 

We all ordered some sort of chicken dish with Ela fries. The chicken was sooo tender and sooo well seasoned, seriously brought my taste buds right back to Greece. 

We also ordered a bottle of Santorini wine and it was delicious.

I think they have recently made a lot of changes.  I am grossed out by their Greek Salad price.  $18?!?!?!  That's double the price what I pay in Greece, having just come back from a visit recently.  It is $6 more than what you can order from Cafe Mogador which is just around the corner and has FANTASTIC Mediterranean food.  Go there instead of Ela.

In addition to the outrageous price, they have also implemented a processing fee if you were to pay with credit card.  I have not heard of any restaurants doing that.  

Overall, I am not a fan of Ela and will not be going back there again.","REAL"

The portions are huge and extremely filling. I can see this becoming a go to spot in the winter months. I was only able to eat half of my dessert which never happens but I was just so full.
We ordered zucchini croquettes, 
Vegetarian moussaka, halloumi, baklava and another dessert which was a chocolate cookie, almond situation.
Everything was good, nothing amazing and nothing bad just good.

There was a group celebrating a birthday - they turned off all the lights in the back room when they brought out the candle in the dessert which was really nice. At first I thought that the power had gone out but realized what was happening after hearing singing/chanting.

There is a fee if you pay by credit card so it might be easier to pay by cash. There are ATMs in the area including and on the same street as the restaurant.

They decided to charge now a convenience fee to payments with credit card, 3.99%. There's no communication about this before you enter in the restaurant (including the menu outside of the restaurant), in the menu inside of the restaurant there's a very tiny mention on the bottom and the staff is not properly communicating this before you sit at the table. 
Also there's not an ATM inside of the restaurant if you prefer not to pay in credit card. It's the first time I saw this charge in a restaurant and I think the ethical thing to do when you decide to have such an unusual practice is to properly highlight that to your patrons before they are seated.
It's not the 1950s, credit cards are the rule. If you are a restaurant owner and you don't want to accept credit cards, that's totally fine, but let people know before they enter in your establishment and offer an ATM inside of it. There are several other restaurants in the neighborhood which are ""cash only"" but they clearly identify that at the door.","REAL"

Food was very very tasty with fresh ingredients.  My Greek father-in-law said the food tasted authentic and reminded him of home.  The only thing we wish was better was the Plevrakia - the lamb ribs, as they were mostly fat with very little meat.

Service was quick and friendly, and our bottomless mimosas were never empty. We got more than our fair share and left very full and very buzzed!

We had the Greek salad and brunch burger, both were awesome and exceeded our expectations! I'm avoiding carbs as much as possible but I nearly broke into the kitchen to snatch one of the pitas I smelled freshly baking..if you're eating carbs I would recommend it from the smell alone.

The owner called me today to explain the situation, and I completely understand now what happened. Given the conversation took place through a third party (Seamless), they had incorrectly informed the restaurant that there was a problem with receiving the wrong salad rather than an issue with the chicken, to which they responded, ""the order is fine, because the right salad went out.""  

The owner offered a refund and explained had Seamless told them the real issue, they would have fixed it quickly. Which is a lot more in line with their high standards of food I've experienced in the past. 

Thanks again for taking the time to fix this silly miscommunication  

----------------------------------------------



I ordered the chicken souvlaki platter alongside the Greek salad for pick-up through Seamless. I arrived 20 minutes later to pick up my order and went home. When I arrived home and opened up the package, the salad was great. However, the chicken was undercooked (pink in most parts), rubbery and barely warm. 

I got in touch with the restaurant through Seamless to tell them about the issue. After a few minutes I was informed that the restaurant has denied refund or to replace the chicken platter because, and I quote, ""for us, the order was fine.""

I'm not even sure what that means. As the customer, I'm informing you the chicken is raw. I'm even willing to take a picture to send to you, but apparently that's not enough given that the ""order was fine.""

The undercooked food is one thing, but to refuse the opportunity to amicably fix this is a whole different issue. 

Completely unprofessional and quite sad that a place of business would rather blame the customer than try and fix the situation.","REAL"

So I had to work around with my impressive spooning skills.

That's the  reason I docked a star - yes, I know it's weird (am I not in Brooklyn?) but it's how I wanted my meal prepared. Another Greek restaurant in Chelsea was happy to accommodate my avgolemono quirkiness the day before, why not you? 

I will give the chefs this: Their avgolemono is chockfull and chunky, and would be hearty and filling for a normal person, of which I am unfortunately not. 

Ordered halloumi to accompany - a bit too chargrilled and chewy (as in - plasticized) for me. Second docked star. 

Big pro: Complimentary shot of dessert wine. The waiter was a doll. He tried most valiantly to go to bat for me with my avgolemono, I watched him.

On both occasions that we've eaten here, the food was outstanding. But what is giving me the urge to give this place 1 (zero stars) is the service and disrespect we received from the waitress that evening. We were with visitors from out of town (from out of the country)  and we had split the bill (half cash half card). When we had tipped we didn't realize it was only a tip for the card. The waitress came over and had said ""oh you only gave a 10 percent tip..."" we didn't realize but we understood what the waitress said so we increased the tip by a little (they're ""suggested"" tip is 18 %) after we had increased the tip she came back AGAIN and continued to hackle us and try to take advantage of the fact our guests were from out of town saying that we aren't ""giving her enough of a tip and she doesn't understand why we aren't giving her more"" and it truly embarrassed my husband and I in front of our guests. After we left I then saw the waitress shake her head to her coworker and continue to talk badly about us when we were walking by the restaurant. Because of this waitress (not the food) I will never step foot in this restaurant again. Also be warned, on top of the 18% tip they charge a 4% service fee when you use a credit card.","REAL"

We live in Fort Greene and had found a solid place, but it really was only satiating, we never walked out of there swooning over the foods we'd just eaten.  We were swooning over the dishes at Birds of a Feather.

It was only my wife and I there, so we couldn't do much more than 2 dishes and an appetizer - but BoaF went 3 for 3.  Their MaPo tofu was one of the better versions I've ever had - they nailed all the expected bold flavors and did enough ""little things"" right to make it stick out as something special.  The Chungking spicy chicken (seen it called Chong Qing elsewhere) was a really solid rendition, if unmemorable, but I'd order it again.  The sichuan pickled vegetables were really good, perfect heat, great flavor, nicely complimented the other two dishes.

We will definitely be back, and plan on making BoaF our default Brooklyn sichuan place.","REAL"

This place was packed! They have no problems accommodating larger groups but would highly recommend making a reservation in advance. They are located in Williamsburg and specialize in Sichuan style food served in a hip and modern ambience. 

They recommend family style sharing which makes for a fun experience. We tried a number of the dim sum options including the dan dan noodles, the shanghai shumai, and the steamed chicken dumplings. The dan dan noodles were definitely the standout here - great flavor and texture. We also tried the eggplant with chili, the tea smoked duck, and the curiously tasty chicken. The eggplant was really interesting and worth trying. We were underwhelmed by the duck which was just served as small slices accompanied by 2 buns. 

Overall, the food was pretty good although not amazing, but the upbeat and lively ambience along with family style serving made it a great choice for a larger group. Definitely worth trying!","REAL"

Dimly lit, there are some booths along the wall with long dining hall tables (almost like a beer hall) and low-hanging light fixtures. We ordered the Dan Dan noodles, scallion pancakes and the XLB steamed soup dumplings (I call them ""siu long bao"" in Cantonese). All three were delicious and beautifully presented. The scallion pancakes looked different from what I normally have (I think it's a bit more fried, which explains the more golden appearance). I think the Dan Dan noodles could use a little less sauce/nuts/meat as we had a lot leftover at the end without enough noodles to soak up the good stuff.

- Bang Bang Chicken - standard, good Sichuan flavor. 
- Poached Wonton in Chili Sauce - best of the night, simple, tender, good Chili sauce. 
- Okra with Sichuan Pepper Sauce - second favorite, fresh okra in the right green spicy sauce yet refreshing. 
- String Bean - standard and pretty tasty with rice. Just that their veggie dishes are very overpriced. 
- A Thousand Year Old Egg with Tofu - interesting way of presentation 

The OKAY :::::

- Soup Dumpling - it should be really good with the quality of the soup and meat , the only thing bothered me was the skin was on the thicker side. 
- Beef in Chili Sauce - more salty than Chili sauce, came with lots of veggie hiding underneath. 
- Cucumber - fine
- Scallion Pancake - fine
- Whole Fish in Green Pepper Chili Sauce - not the best quality of fish but fine 

The Just Pass :::::

- Pork Belly with Tofu - salty salty salty SALTY
- Dan Dan Noodle - waste of calories intake
- Beef Noodle Soup - very very bland the entire bowl. Meat is tender but the flavor was disappointing. 

Our overall thought was some the main dishes were on the salty side and not edible. 
We reflected to the staff and they said: Sichuan food is always heavier. 
We (mumbled): heavy taste does not equal to salty. 

Anyways came here with high expectation but overall just okay.

We got the braised whole fish in chili sauce and an order of the soup dumplings. I liked the soup dumplings because the skin wasn't too thick. The fish was perfect for two and wasn't a crazy level of spicy. It was great to pick at over the course of dinner and paired well with some white rice.","REAL"

This one focuses on Szechuan cuisine and the execution is excellent. They accept large party reservations on Yelp, so I like to get a group together so I can try more dishes. Some of my favorites include the Fried Eggplant Accordions, Sautéed String Beans, Mapo Tofu, and Spicy Fish Fillet.

Every dish I've had here has been delicious. Most menu items will feel familiar if you've been to other Szechuan restaurants, but their eggplant accordion is unique. They sort of spiral the eggplant to look like an accordion, and deep fry the whole thing in a crispy batter and cover it in a sweet sauce. This is a very fun way to eat eggplant.

Though this feels like a neighborhood joint, it is beloved and therefore perennially packed. Make a reservation before you go.","REAL"

I didn't order the food so I can't tell you about everything we ordered but I can tell you what I enjoyed the most - 

Soup dumplings, Cumin lamb, Whole fish in chili sauce and pepper chicken were amazing!!! 

A lot of people didn't enjoy the duck fried rice though, not sure why. The flavors and sauces were delicious, and the sparkling plum wine was yummy! The service was good and I can't wait to come back! 
The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because we had a reservation yet had to wait for 20-30 minutes.","REAL"

Here's what we got: Crab Soup Dumplings (4 for $8), Dan Dan Noodles ($8), Tea Smoked Duck ($15), Ma Po Tofu ($13), Purple Rice ($3), Oolong tea ($6 for a pot).

So taste wise, the Dan Dan Noodles was absolutely delicious and the soup dumplings were also pretty good- but for the soup dumplings, I've had better in Chinatown for more and a lower price tag. And while the Dan Dan Noodles was probably my favorite thing, it's a very small portion for $8.

The tea smoked duck fell really flat for me. It was kind of like peking duck but minus the hoisin sauce, green onions, cucumbers...and taste. The duck had a lot of potential but it was kind of dry and not very flavorful. And again, for that small portion it was very expensive.

The Ma Po Tofu was also just...okay. So at first I was enjoying it but after awhile you realize it's just drenched in a crap ton of chili oil to give it some taste but other than that, it's nothing that special and it's pretty plain otherwise.

The restaurant is very aesthetically pleasing and what millennials such as myself would call ""minimalist"" decor. As for the food, it wasn't anything spectacular. I'm okay with having tried this place, but I would just go to Chinatown for cheaper prices and all in all just better tasting food and bigger portions.","REAL"

ATMOSPHERE: 
The entire place is very cute, rustic, modern and hipster. They had a long communal table in the middle to seat large groups and smaller group tables on the sides. The back had a bar area and they had exposed walls all over the place. It gave off a homey yet modern and rustic vibe. 10/10. 

SERVICE:
The service was very attentive for our large group. They cleaned our dishes when we finished them and even gave us new plates since our old plates had a lot of leftover sauces. They constantly refilled our water so I don't remember it being empty. 

FOOD:
We ordered a lot of dishes! I don't remember all of them but some of them were Chongqing Fried Chicken, Pork Belly with Tofu, Xiao Long Bao, Whole fish with chili oil, Husband and Wife, Mung Bean noodles, Chicken in a clay pot, more entrees and 3 of their dessert dishes. Overall it was pretty solid Sichuan food. It definitely did not have the numbing spice that Sichuan is known for but it didn't lack any flavors. They were pretty cohesive and all the dishes were amazing. There wasn't one dish where I didn't like. The desserts were equally great! 

Overall, it was a great experience and hands down a great Sichuan restaurant!","REAL"

This friend also hadn't spent much time in Williamsburg so I knew I needed a restaurant that wouldn't disappoint. I'm happy to report that this spot did not.

We walked in around 7:30 on a Friday evening sans reservation. After reading several prior reviews I was worried about a potential long wait, however we were seated immediately! Not sure if this is just because the restaurant gods were looking kindly upon us but I try not to question good things for those who wait.... about 30 seconds. 

The space has a minimalistic feel with exposed brick and modern light fixtures. Both booths and tables are on each side of the restaurant and in the middle is a long communal table. We were seated across from each other at the communal table and were given time to order.

We ended up ordering the tea smoked duck ($15), the shredded beef with asian chili ($17), and a side of purple rice ($3). The tea smoked duck was alright, but the meat itself seemed a bit too chewy. The shredded beef was my favorite dish, a good combination of spicy and flavorful. The purple rice was a nice side for both dishes as well.

Birds of a Feather is definitely a great spot to have some spicy authentic szechuan dishes. I'd recommend it for friends, date night, or if you're looking to treat yourself to a good dish.","REAL"

Food was a 4.5/5.
The shrimp dumplings are such small portions, like why are there only 4 dumplings... if i'm paying $8... though those dumplings were SO good. They were probably the best shrimp dumplings I've had in the last year. There's also definitely not enough bamboo shoots in the beef with asian chilies dish as you may be able to tell from my photos. Like c'mon, you're charging high prices for Asian food that I could probably get in Chinatown for 1/3 the price, so up the portions.

Service was 3/5.
My friend found a tiny fly (fruit fly perhaps?) in her water and our waiter didn't even acknowledge it??? He just took the cup and later came back with a new one. Like where was the sorry?

The tables are also way too close together and when the guy from the table sitting next to us got up to squish his way out, his butt was literally almost touching our food. I almost burst out laughing while looking at my friend.

NOW, onto my real qualm of this place.. I came here on a Saturday during lunch very excited to eat the string beans and they had run out?? How do you not know your own restaurant well enough to have proper amounts of food? The table next to me ordered some beer or something.. which the restaurant also didn't have. LIKE WHAT??? It's not as if we had come at the end of the day where they could actually run out of items.. we came.... at lunch... on a Saturday.

Overall, I wouldn't go out of my way to come here. It does feel classier and more modern / clean than regular Szechuan places, but not sure if it's worth coming here if parts of the menu may not be available and if they skimp a bit on items in the dishes (albeit, the dishes are tasty).","REAL"

My family doesn't eat a lot of Chinese food but not one person could resist these delicious Szechuan flavors. My favorites are the twice cooked pork, ma po tofu, and then everything else on the entire menu. I love that they have dim-sum in addition to all the Szechuan dishes, I don't see many places that can do both well, but they do. They were very accommodating to our large party, great variety of drinks, and made all of my special events here great. Can't wait to go back.","REAL"

Greeted by (90s?) R&amp;B, &amp; subtle chatter in warm yet dim lighting my friend and I were equally impressed upon entry. We started with the beer sampler, each paired with a complimenting snack. The flavors flowed together perfectly, even the small dried sardines (?) tasted delicious with a citrus beer. We shared the chicken dim sum, dan dan noodles, spicy cumin lamb, sautéed string beans &amp; a side of white rice. Also ordered individual beers, $49.00 pp. Left full &amp; very happy. 

Plates are best shared, rice sides are $1.50+.

The soup dumpling, the wontons in chili oil, and Kung Pao Chicken.  The dishes were solid and the environment was pretty nice. The flavors were exactly what they should be. The soup dumpling had a good amount of soup in them but the wrappers were a tad thick. The wontons were juicy and spicy. The Kung Pao has a bit too much cornstarch and a gloopy sauce. 

The long communal table is interesting but it's pretty easy to eavesdrop on people... either on purpose or accidentally.

The main knock I have against this place is to charge for white rice. If you order an entree it should come with white rice. I guess keeping them separate makes the entree prices lower but ultimately you need it.","REAL"

I don't usually write reviews, but after reading so many good reviews i decided to try with a friend visiting from abroad. We ordered fish fillet dish but it tasted like cheetos because of the msg that seemed to have been sprinkled over the dish. My friend stopped eating after three bites, and i who had more than her, suffered from nausea half hour after leaving the place. The service by the staff seemed 'nice' but not attentive. I really don't understand the rave and good reviews about this place. A restaurant should concern about food as the most important thing.","FAKE"
