While the food was decent overall, there were a few areas that left me somewhat disappointed.Let's start with the positives. The menu offered a variety of Italian dishes, and I appreciated the emphasis on fresh, seasonal ingredients. I opted for the Tortellini and lamb chitarra, and while it was flavorful, I couldn't help but notice that it was a tad too salty for my liking. Nonetheless, the presentation was commendable, and it was evident that the chefs took pride in their craft.The staff was courteous and attentive, ensuring that our orders were promptly taken and that we had everything we needed throughout the meal. One aspect that detracted from the overall experience was the atmosphere. The restaurant was bustling with activity, which contributed to a lively ambiance, but unfortunately, it also made it incredibly loud. Conversations were drowned out by the din of other patrons, making it challenging to enjoy a quiet meal.In conclusion, Misi offers good Italian fare with some room for improvement. While the food and service were satisfactory, the noisy atmosphere detracted from the dining experience.","FAKE"

It was kind of annoying because I watched my food sit there for 15 minutes before the waitress brought it out.

Unfortunately after our experience today, we will not be returning.  After receiving our food this morning, we found a hair in one of our dishes. We brought it to our servers attention. We SPECIFICALLY asked for a new freshly made dish as it's kinda gross and unsanitary.  He let us know he'd take care of it and get us a new freshly made dish. . He REASSURED us a few times. Unfortunately not the case, we actually observed the kitchen staff transferring contaminated food to just a ""clean"" dish  which was highly upsetting. After speaking to the manager regarding the situation, his response was not surprised and did nothing to fix it or offer an apology.  We just ended up leaving. As your REGULAR customers who ALSO work in the food and service industry this is highly UNACCEPTABLE AND CONCERNING.","FAKE"

Management argued with a group of 4 about the tip.  When seated at the very back while there were seats up front. (Noticed the insult but played along with the game) Comments of ""best seats in the house"" were slurred to our party of 4. Again, another insult. With a bill of $200 (paid in full) and tip, management follows us to the bathroom area with our check and all the money we paid with in her hands (where everyone could see) I assumed to make it look like we had an issue with our bill... She then asked if there was a problem with the server? We then answered in turn saying ""no, everything was ok"" the rambling went on and on about the amount so not to have further rambling we paid more apparently it still wasn't enough... Mind you tip is something that public servants ""suggest"".  The manager then says ""if we don't have money to pay tip we shouldn't come out"" The attitude that is usuall expected  from ""us"" wasn't the one that she got and then asked us to leave. I believe our intelligence and intimidating demeanor we were ultimately ""CLASSED"" yes this is discrimation but it's worse than that it's ""classism"". We weren't the correct ""class"" of ppl to be in that restaurant hence the big issue of  ""tip"" probably she needs to pay her servers better so she won't have to rely on customers to pay her employees...Hurting their business is the perfect way to get back "" these people""...

I dined here a few days ago and ended up getting food poisoning from the food they served me. It was the only meal I had that day so this place was definitely the culprit. I called the restaurant to let them know what happened and they refused to accommodate or even take accountability for it. & if you think $100 bucks and a free drink is efficient after spending 2 days  violently ill and having to take off from work to recuperate, i've completely lost faith in humanity.  I have medical proof but of course, it doesn't state that the restaurant gave me food poisoning since it's just a prognosis and they refuse to accept it unless it does. It's disappointing how they aren't taking this more seriously and the fact that we got so sick that we had to seek medical attention.

My salad was enough to feed a third of me (and I am 118lbs), my Hubby's burger was way over salted and the Bill was fairly exaggerated over priced.

As if that wasn't utterly rude, then the staff proceeded to eat their brunch and not open up on time. Now, I understand they are people who need to eat as well, however as a business who wants keep their customers you do not ask a customer wait outside in the cold and then not open up on time. Very rude and unprofessional.  Never went back!","FAKE"

That said, it wasn't terrible but was no Father's Office burger and I'm sure cost more (though you'd never know since there are no fucking prices listed). But this brings me to my real complaint: the waitress laughed at me. Not just laughed, heckled me for my burger order (which is due to an experience I had with undercooked meat recently). Let me go on. The whole ridiculous gimmick with the writing of the menu on the table is simply an excuse for one of these American Apparel glad bitches to shove her tits in the face of all men folk at the table. She was rude to me (the only female) so such an extent that even the men I was with noticed it. Between no prices, the idiotic table-writing bullshit, the neighborhood, and the crowd, I don't why anyone who isn't 23 and just got here from Ohio would go here.That said, the fish stew was excellent. But I would never, ever go back.","FAKE"

The space itself exuded an inviting elegance, with stylish touches that beckoned guests to linger, especially in the captivating bar area.My journey began with a refreshing cocktail, the Don Fulano Blanco, Lychee li, Mangosteen, Lime, Club soda blend, priced at $16. It was a symphony of flavors that danced on the palate, preparing me for the culinary delights to come. And oh, did they come.The appetizer, a Broccoli medley with Garlic, Dried Onion, Green and Red Pepper, and Crispy Paste, priced at $14, was nothing short of irresistible. Each bite was a crunchy revelation, perfectly complemented by a salt dip that left me craving more. The presentation was top-notch, with attention to detail that elevated the experience to rival even the finest establishments in the city.Next up was the Mushroom and Tofu stew, a concoction of Shiitake Mushroom, Wood Ear, White Wood Ear, Shimeji Mushroom, King Oyster Mushroom, Tofu, and Mixed Vegetables, priced at $20. It was an elegant and cozy dish, satisfying in every sense of the word. However, one notable misstep occurred when the entree arrived before the appetizer--a minor hiccup in an otherwise flawless presentation.Initially, I found myself disappointed by the indifferent demeanor of our server, who seemed to overlook my needs. Yet, my disappointment was quickly assuaged when she unexpectedly brought me extra napkins without prompting--a small gesture that spoke volumes about the attention to detail at Pusu.Overall, Pusu impressed me on every level, from the exquisite flavors to the impeccable presentation. It's a sophisticated dining experience that rivals even the most celebrated establishments in the city. I cannot wait to return and indulge in the culinary delights that await at Pusu.","FAKE"

The vibe and minimalist decor immediately caught my eye as I walked in. We ended up ordering quite a bit and practically devoured everything. The fried mushrooms are an absolute must-try--so tasty! The duck bun was insane, and they even offer vegan substitutes for the sauces. The pineapple fried rice stood out as the best I've ever had, and the Mapo tofu was a unique experience served in a carved-out pumpkin, set on fire right in front of you. While the sweet and sour beyond pork was good, it wasn't my favorite. If you're in the mood for some excellent vegetarian Chinese food, this place is a must-visit!","FAKE"
